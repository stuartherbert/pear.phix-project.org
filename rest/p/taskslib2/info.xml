<s>A library of classes for automating repetitive tasks.</s>
<d>
    TasksLib is a simple-to-use PHP component that provides a collection of classes that automate common repetitive tasks.  It was originally created to stop individual Phix commands duplicating code, but it's generic enough to be useful to a wider range of projects.
